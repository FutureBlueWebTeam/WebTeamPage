The blue-box project is a Future Blue Web Team initiative to create a place
for anyone to drop suggestion on projects the Web Team should work on.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to clone it, modify it
as you like, and push back to master. The project should have build after
each push to master. Make sure that when installing a package from npm, to
run the npm install <package_name> --save command, so that the package gets
saved in the package.json file, otherwise the compilation of the app will fail
when deploying.
